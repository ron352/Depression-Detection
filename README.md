# Depression-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This project involves prediction of depression with proper data processing .Here,

The covid_mental_health_train.csv contains the details of a subset of random participants who have taken in the the survey and more importantly, who were already diagnosed with depression or not!

The covid_mental_health_test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the diagnosis of depression for each participants.

The process is about using8610 participants in the covid_mental_health_train.csv data, predict whether the other 2723 participants found in covid_mental_health_test.csv were diagnosed with depression or not.
